Reference to any statute and statutory provision shall be construed as those in force from time to time. References
to time shall mean the time in London unless stated otherwise. References to days are business days unless
otherwise stated.
Chapter headings, section headings and the titles and numbers of rules are for guidance and ease of reference only.

For the purpose of these rules, an act or course of conduct includes both acts and omissions. Terms in bold are
defined terms and shall have the meanings set out in the Definitions unless the context otherwise requires, and
cognate expressions shall be construed consistently with them.

Rules with supplementary guidance are flagged with the notation “G” with the relevant guidance located
immediately after the rule. A breach of the guidance is evidence of a breach of the rule.

A breach of the Rules would be subject to the disciplinary processes currently in place.

These rules shall be construed in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of England and Wales. References
to any EU regulation as applied in the UK means a reference to the relevant regulation as it is applied in the UK
pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 following IP Completion Day (as defined in the European
Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020).

The Exchange shall not be liable in damages for anything done or omitted in the discharge of these rules unless it
is shown that the act or omission was done in bad faith.
